Traveling-OWL
=============

This application provides a lightweight and intuitive way
to plan excursions. It is built upon Ember.js and handelbars.
As backend it uses a semantic database based on Stardog.

It was developed within the scope of the bachelor-thesis
of Mira Günzburger (gunzm1@bfh.ch) and Sven Osterwalder
(ostes2@bfh.ch).

Installation notes
==================

If you actually plan to use this application on your 
(web-) server, you may want to install bower first to be
able to install the needed libraries.
You may then install them within the main directory:

`bower install`

and you should be good to go. If you have any questions,
feel free to contact us.

Configuration
=============
Find the configuration under js/config.js. You may want
to change the following attributes (please do not touch
the other ones :)):
* appName
* sparql:endpoint
* sparql:database
* sparql:user
* sparql:password
